    <p>I live in a small town in Colorado called La Jara. Some of my hobbies include fishing, hunting, and playing video games. I am not married, but I do have a girlfriend. For my career I want to be a gunsmith with a backround in business management.<p>
    <p>I was raised in the church and served a mission in the California, Riverside mission. One of the advantages of taking this course is learning the basics of how web development works for a possible future career in it, an if not that, a backround in it for future use.<p>
